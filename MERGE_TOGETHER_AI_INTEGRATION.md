# MERGE_TOGETHER_AI_INTEGRATION.md

## Overview
This document provides instructions for merging the Together.ai integration feature branch (`feature/together-ai-integration`) into the main branch. This feature adds support for Together.ai as a second LLM provider alongside OpenAI, enabling users to choose between different AI model providers.

## Feature Summary
- **Provider Selection**: Users can choose between OpenAI and Together.ai providers
- **Model Support**: Added 6 Together.ai models including DeepSeek, Llama, and GPT-OSS variants
- **RAG Integration**: Full RAG system support for both providers (embeddings + chat)
- **Topic Explorer**: JSON mode support for Together.ai models
- **Document Processing**: Provider-aware document indexing and retrieval

## Merge Instructions

### Step 1: Pre-Merge Checklist
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass
- [ ] Verify Together.ai dependency is installed (`pip install together==1.5.25`)
- [ ] Test both OpenAI and Together.ai providers
- [ ] Verify document upload with both providers
- [ ] Test Topic Explorer mode with Together.ai models

### Step 2: Merge Process
```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Merge feature branch
git merge feature/together-ai-integration

# Push merged changes
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Post-Merge Verification
- [ ] Test provider selection in UI
- [ ] Verify API key handling for both providers
- [ ] Test document upload with both providers
- [ ] Verify RAG queries work with both providers
- [ ] Test Topic Explorer with Together.ai models
- [ ] Check that existing OpenAI functionality still works

### Step 4: Deployment Considerations

#### Environment Variables
- No new environment variables required
- API keys are provided by users through the UI

#### Dependencies
- Ensure `together==1.5.25` is installed in production
- Update `requirements.txt` in deployment

#### Database Changes
- No database schema changes required
- Session management remains unchanged

## Breaking Changes
- **None** - All changes are backward compatible
- Default behavior remains OpenAI if no provider is specified

## New Features

### Provider Selection UI
- Dropdown in settings panel to choose between OpenAI and Together.ai
- Automatic model switching based on provider selection
- Provider-specific API key placeholders

### Enhanced System Messages
- Added LaTeX math notation support across all modes
- Enhanced with emoji and engaging language
- Consistent formatting instructions

### Topic Explorer Improvements
- Provider-aware default model selection
- Together.ai models support JSON mode
- Enhanced educational content formatting
