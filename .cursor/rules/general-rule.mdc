## Rules to Follow

- You must always commit your changes whenever you update code. 
- You must always try and write code that is well documented. (self or commented is fine)
- You must only work on a single feature at a time.
- You must explain your decisions thouroughly to the user.
- Ensure bothe the frontend and backend apps is Containerized (provide a Dockerfile that runs as non-root) so it can run on Container management tools like (Docker or Podman) and also can be packaged and deployed on Cloud Container-based environments like Kubernetes or Red Hat OpenShift.
