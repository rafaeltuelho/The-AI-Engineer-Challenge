# Merge Instructions: Auto-Submit Suggested Questions in Topic Explorer Mode

## Overview
This feature automatically submits suggested questions when clicked in "Topic Explorer" mode, eliminating the need for users to manually click the send button.

## Changes Made
- Modified `handleSuggestedQuestionClick` function in `ChatInterface.tsx`
- Added conditional logic to automatically submit questions in Topic Explorer mode
- Preserved existing behavior for other chat modes (AI Chat, RAG)

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/components/ChatInterface.tsx`

## How to Merge

### Option 1: GitHub Web Interface (Recommended)
1. Go to the repository on GitHub
2. Create a new Pull Request from `feature/multi-document-support` to `main`
3. Title: "feat: Auto-submit suggested questions in Topic Explorer mode"
4. Description: "Automatically submits suggested questions when clicked in Topic Explorer mode, improving user experience by reducing required clicks."
5. Review the changes and merge when ready

### Option 2: GitHub CLI
```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Merge the feature branch
git merge feature/multi-document-support

# Push to main
git push origin main

# Delete the feature branch (optional)
git branch -d feature/multi-document-support
git push origin --delete feature/multi-document-support
```

## Testing
After merging, test the following scenarios:
1. Switch to Topic Explorer mode
2. Ask a question that generates suggested questions
3. Click on a suggested question badge
4. Verify the question is automatically submitted without needing to click send
5. Test in other modes (AI Chat, RAG) to ensure they still require manual send button click

## Technical Details
- The implementation uses a synthetic form event to trigger the existing `handleSubmit` function
- Only applies to Topic Explorer mode; other modes maintain existing behavior
- Clears suggested questions immediately when clicked to prevent duplicate submissions
