# Merge Instructions: Multi-Document Support Feature

## Overview
This feature branch adds comprehensive support for processing Word (.docx) and PowerPoint (.pptx) documents alongside existing PDF support. The refactoring maintains full backward compatibility while extending the document processing capabilities.

## Changes Made

### 1. Core Refactoring
- **Renamed**: `LightweightPDFProcessor` → `DocumentProcessor`
- **Added**: Multi-format document processing support
- **Maintained**: Full backward compatibility with existing PDF processing

### 2. New Dependencies Added
- `python-docx==1.1.2` - For Word document processing
- `python-pptx==0.6.23` - For PowerPoint presentation processing

### 3. New Features
- **File Type Detection**: Automatic detection of PDF, DOCX, and PPTX files
- **Multi-Format Text Extraction**: Specialized extraction methods for each format
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Proper error handling for unsupported file types
- **Enhanced Metadata**: File type information included in processing metadata

### 4. Supported File Types
- **PDF** (.pdf) - Using PyPDF2 and pdfplumber (existing functionality)
- **Word** (.docx, .doc) - Using python-docx library
- **PowerPoint** (.pptx, .ppt) - Using python-pptx library

### 5. API Changes
- **New Method**: `process_document(file_path)` - Main method for all document types
- **Backward Compatibility**: `process_pdf(pdf_path)` - Still available for existing code

## Files Modified
- `api/rag_lightweight.py` - Complete refactoring with multi-format support
- `api/requirements.txt` - Added new dependencies

## Testing
- ✅ File type detection works correctly for all supported formats
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained
- ✅ Error handling for unsupported file types
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved

git branch -d feature/multi-document-support
git push origin --delete feature/multi-document-support
```

## Post-Merge Steps
1. **Update Documentation**: Update any API documentation to reflect the new multi-format capabilities
2. **Deploy Dependencies**: Ensure the new dependencies are installed in production
3. **Test in Production**: Verify that the new functionality works in the production environment
4. **Update Frontend**: Consider updating the frontend to accept and display multiple file types

## Rollback Plan
If issues arise after merging:
```bash
# Revert the merge commit
git revert -m 1 <merge-commit-hash>

# Or reset to previous state (if no other commits were made)
git reset --hard HEAD~1
git push origin main --force
```

## Benefits of This Feature
1. **Expanded Document Support**: Users can now process Word and PowerPoint documents
2. **Unified Interface**: Single API for processing multiple document types
3. **Better User Experience**: No need to convert documents to PDF before processing
4. **Future-Proof**: Easy to add more document types in the future
5. **Maintained Compatibility**: Existing code continues to work without changes

## Security Considerations
- All document processing maintains the same security boundaries
- File size limits (50MB) apply to all document types
- Same error handling and validation for all formats
- No additional security risks introduced

---
**Note**: This feature maintains full backward compatibility, so existing integrations will continue to work without any changes required.
