# UI Improvements and Bug Fixes Merge Instructions

This document explains how to merge the UI improvements and bug fixes back to the main branch.

## Changes Made

The following improvements and bug fixes have been implemented:

1. **PDF Upload Button**: Moved PDF upload button to the left side of the message input field
2. **RAG Query Integration**: Integrated RAG Query functionality into the main chat panel - users can now ask questions about uploaded PDFs directly in the chat
3. **New Chat Button Logic**: The New Chat button is now only enabled after the user enters their API key
4. **Closable API Key Info**: Made the API Key info banner closable
5. **RAG Mode Persistence**: Once a PDF is uploaded, the entire conversation stays in RAG mode
6. **Conversation Management**: Fixed conversation history loading and saving with debugging
7. **Removed Left Panel Sections**: Removed PDF Upload and RAG Query sections from the left panel
8. **Closable PDF Banner**: Made PDF Documents Ready banner closable and it disappears on new chat
9. **Session Banner Persistence**: Session-based conversation info banner now appears only once and persists dismissal using localStorage
10. **RAG Conversation History**: Fixed RAG mode conversations not being stored in conversation history - now all conversations (regular and RAG) are properly stored
