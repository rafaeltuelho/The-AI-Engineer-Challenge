## Feature: Lightweight RAG Optimization for Vercel Deployment

This feature optimizes the application for Vercel's free tier by replacing heavy ML dependencies with lightweight alternatives while maintaining full RAG functionality. This branch includes comprehensive Vercel deployment configuration, dependency management with uv, and extensive frontend/backend improvements.

### Major Changes Made

- **Backend Dependencies**: Replaced heavy ML libraries (docling, PyTorch, CUDA) with lightweight alternatives (PyPDF2, pdfplumber)
- **PDF Processing**: Created lightweight PDF processor that maintains RAG functionality
- **Memory Optimization**: Reduced build size from ~4GB to ~50MB to fit Vercel free tier constraints
- **Vercel Configuration**: Complete Vercel deployment setup with proper routing and build configuration
- **Dependency Management**: Migrated to uv for faster, more reliable Python dependency management
- **Frontend Improvements**: Enhanced chat interface, PDF upload, and RAG query components
- **API Documentation**: Comprehensive OpenAPI documentation with request headers
- **Session Management**: Improved conversation persistence and RAG mode indicators
