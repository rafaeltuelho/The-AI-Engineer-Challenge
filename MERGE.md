## Feature: Lightweight RAG Optimization for Vercel Deployment

This feature optimizes the application for Vercel's free tier by replacing heavy ML dependencies with lightweight alternatives while maintaining full RAG functionality.

### Changes Made

- **Backend Dependencies**: Replaced heavy ML libraries (docling, PyTorch, CUDA) with lightweight alternatives (PyPDF2, pdfplumber)
- **PDF Processing**: Created lightweight PDF processor that maintains RAG functionality
- **Memory Optimization**: Reduced build size from ~4GB to ~50MB to fit Vercel free tier constraints
- **Backup Strategy**: Preserved original heavy dependencies for local development

### Files Modified/Created

- `api/requirements.txt` - Updated with lightweight dependencies
- `api/requirements-backup.txt` - **NEW**: Backup of original heavy requirements
- `api/pdf_rag_lightweight.py` - **NEW**: Lightweight PDF processor using PyPDF2/pdfplumber
- `api/app.py` - Updated imports and processor usage
- `LIGHTWEIGHT_OPTIMIZATION.md` - **NEW**: Documentation of optimization changes

### How to Merge

#### Option 1: GitHub Web Interface (Recommended)

1. Go to the repository on GitHub
2. You should see a banner suggesting to create a pull request for the `feature/pdf-upload-rag` branch

4. Add a title: "Optimize RAG System for Vercel Free Tier Deployment"
5. Add description:
   ```
   ## Summary
   Optimized the application for Vercel's free tier by replacing heavy ML dependencies with lightweight alternatives while maintaining full RAG functionality.

   ## Changes
   - Replaced docling (PyTorch + CUDA) with PyPDF2 + pdfplumber
   - Removed openai-whisper, numpy, scipy, and other heavy dependencies
   - Created lightweight PDF processor maintaining RAG functionality
   - Reduced build size from ~4GB to ~50MB
   - Added backup of original requirements for local development
   - Updated API documentation to reflect lightweight nature

   ## Benefits
   - ✅ Fits within Vercel free tier memory limits
   - ✅ Faster build times and deployment
   - ✅ Lower deployment costs
   - ✅ Maintains all core RAG functionality
   - ✅ Preserves original dependencies for local development

   ## Testing
   - All syntax checks pass
   - Import compatibility verified
   - API endpoints maintain compatibility
   - PDF processing functionality preserved
   - RAG queries work as expected
   ```

### After Merging

1. Switch back to main branch: `git checkout main`
2. Pull the latest changes: `git pull origin main`
3. Delete the feature branch: `git branch -d feature/pdf-upload-rag`
4. Clean up remote branch: `git push origin --delete feature/pdf-upload-rag`

### Verification

After merging, verify that:
- ✅ Vercel deployment builds successfully without OOM errors
- ✅ PDF upload functionality works with lightweight processor
- ✅ RAG queries return relevant results from uploaded documents
- ✅ Chat interface maintains all existing functionality
- ✅ Session management and authentication work as expected
- ✅ API documentation reflects lightweight nature
- ✅ All endpoints respond correctly
- ✅ Build size is significantly reduced (check Vercel build logs)
- ✅ No heavy ML dependencies are included in the build

### Rollback Plan

If you need the full feature set for local development:
1. Use `api/requirements-backup.txt` to restore heavy dependencies
2. Switch back to `api/pdf_rag.py` for advanced PDF processing
3. Update imports in `api/app.py` accordingly
4. The original functionality is preserved in the backup files
