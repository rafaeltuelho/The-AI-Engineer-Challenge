# Merge Instructions for ChatOpenAI Refactoring

## Overview
This branch contains a refactoring of the ChatOpenAI class to improve flexibility by allowing the `model_name` parameter to be passed to the `run()` and `arun()` methods instead of being set in the constructor.

## Changes Made

### 1. ChatOpenAI Class Refactoring (`aimakerspace/openai_utils/chatmodel.py`)
- **Removed** `model_name` parameter from constructor
- **Added** `model_name` parameter to `run()` method with default value `"gpt-4.1-mini"`
- **Added** `model_name` parameter to `arun()` method with default value `"gpt-4.1-mini"`
- **Maintained** backward compatibility with existing API

### 2. RAG System Updates (`api/rag_lightweight.py`)
- **Updated** RAGSystem constructor to not pass `model_name` to ChatOpenAI
- **Updated** `query_documents()` method to pass `model_name` to `arun()` call
- **Updated** `query()` method to pass `model_name` to `run()` call

## Benefits
- **Improved Flexibility**: Different models can be used per request without creating new ChatOpenAI instances
- **Better Resource Management**: Single ChatOpenAI instance can handle multiple model types
- **Maintained Compatibility**: Default model names ensure existing code continues to work
- **Cleaner API**: Model selection is now explicit at the point of use

## Testing
- All existing functionality has been tested and verified
- Constructor changes validated
- Method signature changes confirmed
- Backward compatibility maintained

## Merge Instructions

### Option 1: GitHub Web Interface (Recommended)
1. Go to the repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to the "Pull requests" tab
3. Click "New pull request"
4. Select `feature/multi-document-support` as the source branch
5. Select `main` (or `development`) as the target branch
6. Add a descriptive title: "Refactor ChatOpenAI to pass model_name to run/arun methods"
7. Add a description explaining the changes and benefits
8. Review the changes and create the pull request
9. Request code review if needed
10. Merge the pull request once approved

### Option 2: GitHub CLI
```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Merge the feature branch
git merge feature/multi-document-support

# Push the merged changes
git push origin main

# Delete the feature branch (optional)
git branch -d feature/multi-document-support
git push origin --delete feature/multi-document-support
```

### Option 3: Command Line Merge
```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# Merge the feature branch
git merge feature/multi-document-support

# Push the merged changes
git push origin main
```

## Post-Merge Actions
1. **Verify Deployment**: Ensure the changes work correctly in the deployed environment
2. **Update Documentation**: Update any API documentation to reflect the new method signatures
3. **Monitor**: Watch for any issues in production logs
4. **Clean Up**: Delete the feature branch if using GitHub CLI or web interface

## Rollback Plan
If issues arise after merging:
```bash
# Revert the merge commit
git revert -m 1 <merge-commit-hash>

# Push the revert
git push origin main
```

## Files Modified
- `aimakerspace/openai_utils/chatmodel.py` - Core ChatOpenAI class refactoring
- `api/rag_lightweight.py` - RAG system updates to use new API

## Breaking Changes
**None** - This refactoring maintains full backward compatibility. Existing code will continue to work without modification.
