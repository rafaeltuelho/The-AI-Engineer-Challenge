# General Rules

- You must always commit your changes whenever you update code.
- Make sure any sensitive information (eg. API keys, passwords) are not persisted anywhere without hashing. Also never pass API keys or any sort of sensitive keys as HTTP query params.
- Always ensure the backend API uses security good practices to avoid known HTTP/web security flaws.
