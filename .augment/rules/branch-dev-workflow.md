# Branch Development Workflow

 - You prefer to use branch development.

 - Before writing any code, check if you are in a feature branch (eg. 'feature/branch_name'). If not already in an existing feature branch, create one to hold the changes.

 - After you are done - provide instructions in a "MERGE.md" file that explains how to merge the changes back to main with both a GitHub PR route and a GitHub CLI route.
